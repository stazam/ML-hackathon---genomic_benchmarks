# ML-hackathon---genomic_benchmarks

This repository is for purpose of ML - benchamrk genomic Hackathon contest.

Files:
1. **help_functions.py** - contain functions for preprocessing genomic sequences for the need of NN and also other machine learning models.
2. **human_nontata_promoters_models.ipynb** - colab notebook with implementation of NN - specifically commbination of convolutional + Bidirecional LSTM layers.

The best result was 86% on dataset human_nontata_promoters.
